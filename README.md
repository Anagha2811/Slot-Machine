# Slot-Machine
This Python code is a simple text-based slot machine game, following coding conventions. Players can deposit, spin the machine, and win based 
on symbol combinations. A basic foundation for further game development.

This Python code is the foundation of a text-based slot machine game, implementing fundamental game mechanics. It employs clear and conventional 
coding practices to create an interactive gambling experience. The code begins by defining constants such as MAX_LINES, MAX_BET, and MIN_BET, 
establishing the limits for player bets, ensuring fairness in the game. Additionally, it sets up the grid dimensions of the slot machine with ROWS and COLS, 
and specifies the frequency and values of game symbols using dictionaries like symbol_count and symbol_value.

The core of the game revolves around several functions: spin, which simulates a spin of the slot machine; check_winnings, which identifies winning combinations
and calculates winnings; and print_slot_machine, responsible for displaying the current state of the slot machine grid. To ensure a smooth gaming 
experience, the code includes input validation loops, prompting players to deposit an initial amount, choose the number of lines to bet on, and set the bet amount 
per line.

Overall, this code serves as a solid starting point for a basic slot machine game. Players can deposit funds, spin the slot machine, and continue playing or quit 
at any time. It provides feedback on the player's current balance, winnings, and winning lines, enhancing the gaming experience. While it represents a straightforward
implementation, developers can expand upon this foundation by adding more features, graphics, and interactivity to create a more engaging slot machine game.
